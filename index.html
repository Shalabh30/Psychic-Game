<!-- Pseudo code for Psychic Game

- Computer to make a choice
- User to make a choice upto 9 times
- Capture those choices: computers and users
- compare those choices and determine win, loss and tie
- Display the result to the user -->

// Computer to make choices.
// Create an array that lists all options for computer a to z.

// Creating a variable to hold our new HTML. Our HTML now keeps track of the user and computer guesses, and wins/losses/ties.

		"<p>Losses: " + Losses + "</p>" +
		"<p>GuessesLeft: " + GuessesLeft + "</p>"

//Set the inner HTML content of the game div to our html string

	document.querySelector("#game").innerHTML = html;

};



// Problems to Fix:
// computer is not selecting another value after win or loss.
// Users current choice is only getting displayed on the screen, past choices are not displaying. It should display all choices on the screen. something to do with Array "LettersGuessed".
// Once the game is started, "Psychich game" and "Guess what letter I am thinking of" is not displaying on the screen.
